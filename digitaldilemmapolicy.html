   <h3>Technical Background</h3>
   <div id="div2">
   <p>
     When you log onto the internet at your home, office, school, library or internet café, you are connecting through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as Comcast or AT&T. The ISP then assigns your individual computer an IP Address, which is similar to a postal address in that it is used to identify you and transport information. Web sites have IP addresses as well. When you browse to a certain web page on your computer, you are actually requesting information from a particular IP address.  These IP addresses are difficult to remember, so the Domain Name System (DNS) allows IP addresses to be associated with human-readable “domain names” such as example.com. Originally, this system was created in order to translate between human-readable domain names and IP addresses but now it is used to censor certain websites by blacklisting them. Censorship can thus occur at different points in the Internet system, from whole networks, certain ports, individual domains or even specific keywords identified by filtering software. The government implemented the HTTPS protocol to establish a secure connection with the servers. HTTP is a protocol for computers to request and share the pages that make up the World Wide Web on the Internet. The goal is to make it safe and secure to transmit sensitive information including personal data, payment or login information. People argue that censorship is violating their freedom of speech while others are saying that a lack of censorship is resulting in them not feeling safe. This is the dilemma of Internet censorship.
   </p>

   <br>
   <h3>Recomended Policy</h3>
   <div id="div4">
   <p>
     I recommend that we have Partial Censorship. The government should continue to blacklist certain words and implement the HTTPS protocol. The personal information of everyone should be protected. In addition there should be a removal of fake news, racism, anti-semetic and heavily biased comments that could start a riot or cult. People should be held liable for the information they share, how it is shared and the effect it has on others.
