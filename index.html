       <h2>Lesson #1 : Welcome to the Internet
    </h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learnt how computers are connected into networks and the tradeoffs involved in building different types of networks.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      1. How do you use the Internet?
<br>
Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?
    </h5>
     
    <h6>
      In a typical day, I'd use the internet to check my emails, follow the latest trends see the news on popular social media channels, talk with friends, family and work on school work. I use the internet for everything in my daily life. I use the internet to track the bus and get where I am going.  The internet is now a primary utility.  It now has a tremendous impact on my daily life.

   <h2>Lesson #2 : Building a Network
    </h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we continued to learn from Lesson 1 how computers are connected into networks and the tradeoffs involved in building different types of networks. We expanded more on buliding different types of networks and their tradeoffs. 
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.
    </h5>
     <img src="pic for lesson 2.png" width="100px">
    <h6>
      1. The message from person A could go through person B then to person D. 
      <br>
      2. The message could go from person b to person C and then person D. 
      <br>
      3. If person b is out of commission, the message you can go to person E then to person C then to person D.

   <h2>Lesson #3 : The Need for Addressing
    </h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learnt how computers are able to send information across a network even though the computers may not be directly connected.We investigated the protocols used on the Internet to make this possible.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      Pick the two statements that are true about the Internet Protocol (IP):
    </h5>
    <h6>
      a) Each device or computer on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address.
      <br>
      b) IP is the shared way that all devices and computers label their messages with the sender and receiver's addresses.
    </h6>
     
    <h5>
      Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.
    </h5>
    <h6>
      IP addresses uniquely identifying people on the internet and routing messages between them. The IP addresses allows computers to see where the device is coming from.
    </h6>
   </div>
  <br>
   
   <div class="div">
       <h2>Lesson #4 : Routers and Redundancy
    </h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learnt how information is routed through the Internet and the reasons networks often will include many multiple paths between different points in the network.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      Pick Two: If the post office delivered mail exactly like the routers deliver messages on the Internet, which of the following statements would be true?
    </h5>
    <h6>
      a)The mailman would sometimes take a different path to deliver each letter to your home
      <br>
      b)Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put inside envelopes
    </h6>

    <h5>
      What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?
    </h5>
    <h6>
      Redundancy can be a backup if individual components fail by having more than one path between any two connected devices in a network. A con is that the message can last longer to transmit and get lost. 
    </h6>

   <br>
   <div class="div">
   <h2>Lesson #5 : Packets
    </h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learnt how information travelling over the Internet is divided into many packets that travel separately through the network as well as the protocols that allow this process to work even when some packets are lost or delayed.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      Which of the following is true regarding the way information is transmitted on the Internet?
    </h5>
    <h6>
       Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.
    </h6>

     <h5>
       Terminology Matching

    <h6>

   <h2>Lesson #6 : HTTP and DNS
    </h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learnt how websites are shared on the Internet and then examine whether everyone actually has equal access to information on the World Wide Web.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
      Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide Web
    </h5>
    <h6>
      a) The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using HTTP
      <br>
      b) HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet
    </h6>

     <h5>
       In your own words explain the following about the Domain Name System
<br>
What problem does the DNS solve?
<br>
How does the DNS help the world wide web scale so that billions of users can access billions of web pages?
    </h5>
    <h6>
When you type in a URL in your browser, DNS resolves the domain name into an IP address. If the DNS does not know an IP address it will ask other DNS servers then when it gets the new IP address, it saves it in a routing table for future reference. To scale the internet, They have a distributed hierarchy. They have a series of DNS servers that monitor .org, and .com.
